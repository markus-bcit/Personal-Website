    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Hi! My name is <strong>Markus</strong>. I'm from Coquitlam and just
      graduated from high school. I play lacrosse for the Coquitlam Adanacs and
      some of my
      <em> interests</em>
      are snowboarding, fitness, and technology. I've built some computers in
      the past and done some very basic code, but I've never gone too in depth.
      I chose the CIT program because I see a career for myself in the industry.
